# ScreenReaderSimulator

## Overview
ScreenReaderSimulator is a Python-based program that simulates a screen reader. It can read aloud user-provided text or text from a simulated user interface file. This project demonstrates basic text-to-speech functionality using the `pyttsx3` library in Python.

## Features
- **Text-to-Speech**: Reads aloud any text entered by the user.
- **UI Simulation**: Reads aloud text from a file representing a user interface (e.g., `venmo_labels.txt`).
- **Simple Interface**: Choose whether to input text manually or read from a simulated UI file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pyttsx3` library

Install the library using pip if you donâ€™t have it:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3
