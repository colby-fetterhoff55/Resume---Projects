# Resume---Projects
A showcase of selected Computer Science projects I’ve completed at Montana State University and independently. Includes systems programming, compiler design, networking, and security projects.

## Projects
- **SimplyDelivery**: A Python-based order and delivery management simulation.
- **ScreenReader**: A Python program simulating a text-to-speech screen reader for accessibility.
- **Battleship with Sockets**: A single-player Battleship game implemented in Python using client-server socket communication.
- **Simple File Transfer**: A Python implementation of a Reliable Data Transfer (RDT) model that sends and reconstructs image files between a client and server.
- **Link Layer Token Passing Protocol**: A simulation of a token-passing network protocol across five nodes where only the token-holding node can transmit packets.
- **Message Authentication Codes**: A Python client-server application demonstrating encrypted messaging and MAC-based authentication with simulated packet corruption.
- **Snowboarding Fun Fact Cloud API**: A Flask REST API deployed on AWS EC2 that serves random snowboarding fun facts and request metadata through two endpoints.

Each project contains a README with instructions on how to run and use the code.
